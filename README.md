# Introduction [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joeltimothyoh/docker-sourceservers.svg?branch=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/joeltimothyoh/docker-sourceservers)

Builds up-to-date **Source** / **GoldSrc** dedicated server images through use of `steamcmd`.

## Supported Tags

* `latest`, `<version>`  [(/build/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/joeltimothyoh/docker-sourceservers/blob/travis/build/Dockerfile)

## Notes

Dedicated servers hosted on **Steam** are usually required to be running the *latest version* in order for clients to connect. Pulling `latest` for the images should mostly suffice.
