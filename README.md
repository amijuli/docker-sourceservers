# Introduction

Builds up-to-date **Source** / **GoldSrc** dedicated server images through use of `steamcmd`.

## Supported Tags

* `latest`, `<version>`  [(/build/Dockerfile)](https://gitlab.com/theohbrothers/docker-sourceservers/blob/master/build/Dockerfile)

## Notes

* Head over to our [repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/theohbrothers) for a list of available games and versions.
* Dedicated servers hosted on **Steam** are usually required to be running the *latest version* in order for clients to connect. Pulling `latest` for the images should mostly suffice.
